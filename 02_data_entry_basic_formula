📌 **Goal**: Learn data entry, formatting, and basic formulas in Excel.

🎯 This part is inspired by a Skill Course YouTube video. Here’s what I practiced:

---

## ✅ What I Practiced in Excel

- 🧩 **Autofill** Employee IDs and Names for additional rows
- 💰 Format the “**Salary**” column using **Currency Style**
- 🔲 Applied **Borders** and **Alignment** (Center, Left, Right)
- 📅 Changed **Date Format** to DD-MM-YYYY
- ➕ Inserted / Deleted additional **Rows or Columns**
- 🧮 Applied **Basic Formulas**:
  - `=SUM()`, `=AVERAGE()`, `=MIN()`, `=MAX()`
- 🎨 Used **Conditional Formatting** to:
  - Highlight salaries above ₹75,000
  - Highlight “Sales” Department using a **formula-based rule**

## 🧠 Short Summary of Formulas Used

| Formula Type              | Example                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Sum                       | `=SUM(B2:B10)`                     |
| Average                   | `=AVERAGE(B2:B10)`                 |
| Minimum                   | `=MIN(B2:B10)`                     |
| Maximum                   | `=MAX(B2:B10)`                     |
| Conditional Formatting    | `=B2>75000` or `=D2="Sales"`       |

# 🎨 Conditional Formatting in Excel – Notes by AbhinayTheAnalyst

## 🔍 Why Conditional Formatting?
Conditional Formatting helps highlight cells based on their values.  
It brings patterns, outliers, or rules visually into attention.

---

## ✅ What I Have Learned

### 1. 🔥 Highlight Cells Based On Value
- Example: Highlight salary > 50000
- Use: **Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cell Rules > Greater Than**

---

### 2. 🌈 Color Scales, Data Bars, Icon Sets
- **Data Bars**: Show visual size of numbers.
- **Color Scales**: Green to red based on value.
- **Icon Sets**: Arrows, flags, etc. based on rules.

---

### 3. 🧠 Formula-Based Conditional Formatting

#### 📌 Use this path:
**Home > Conditional Formatting > New Rule > Use a formula to determine which cells to format**

---

### 🧪 Example 1: Highlight all rows where salary > 50000

| Name | Age | Salary |
|------|-----|--------|
| Golu | 23  | 45000  |
| Radha| 27  | 55000  |

🧾 **Formula:**
```excel
=$C2>50000

✅ Column C is fixed → Row 2 is dynamic.


---

🔄 Absolute vs Relative Reference (Dollar $ Sign)

Reference	Meaning

A1	Relative (moves with drag)
$A$1	Absolute (fixed)
$A1	Fixed column, changing row
A$1	Fixed row, changing column




⚠️ Important Tip

If formula misbehaves in Conditional Formatting, check your $ signs.
Use $ only where you want to lock row or column while formatting.


---

❓ Real-World Case

Use case: In employee data, highlight rows where:

Salary > 50000

Age < 25


Formula to use:

=AND($C2>50000, $B2<25)


---

🧠 Summary

Conditional Formatting = Data Analysis + Visual Insight.

Learn $ usage properly to avoid mistakes.

Use real datasets like Employee salary, Sales reports etc.
