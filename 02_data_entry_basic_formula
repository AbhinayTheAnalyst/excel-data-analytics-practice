# 🎨 Conditional Formatting in Excel – Notes by AbhinayTheAnalyst

## 🔍 Why Conditional Formatting?
Conditional Formatting helps highlight cells based on their values.  
It brings patterns, outliers, or rules visually into attention.

---

## ✅ What I Have Learned

### 1. 🔥 Highlight Cells Based On Value
- Example: Highlight salary > 50000
- Use: **Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cell Rules > Greater Than**

---

### 2. 🌈 Color Scales, Data Bars, Icon Sets
- **Data Bars**: Show visual size of numbers.
- **Color Scales**: Green to red based on value.
- **Icon Sets**: Arrows, flags, etc. based on rules.

---

### 3. 🧠 Formula-Based Conditional Formatting

#### 📌 Use this path:
**Home > Conditional Formatting > New Rule > Use a formula to determine which cells to format**

---

### 🧪 Example 1: Highlight all rows where salary > 50000

| Name | Age | Salary |
|------|-----|--------|
| Golu | 23  | 45000  |
| Radha| 27  | 55000  |

🧾 **Formula:**
```excel
=$C2>50000
