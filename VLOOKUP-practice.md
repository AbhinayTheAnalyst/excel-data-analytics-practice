NOW just by changing lookup value i got all results i.e 106 got name salary etc at this specifc and on typing 103  and so on i found right result

VLOOKUP with match:
=match(lookupvalue,lookup array,match type)  this was seems something big but match is nothing but give  column no. looku value is column and in row similarly
i practiced to many types match as seen below:

=INDEX(result_range, MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_range, 0))
