### üìä Why Use Statistical Formulas in Excel?

While the Status Bar gives quick values like Sum, Average, Count,
Statistical formulas are essential for:

1. ‚úÖ Permanent, visible results in your sheet
2. ‚úÖ Auto-updating with changing data
3. ‚úÖ Conditional logic using IF, AVERAGEIF, etc.
4. ‚úÖ Creating dynamic dashboards and reports
5. ‚úÖ Sharing sheets professionally with clear calculations

#### Common Statistical Functions:
- `=SUM(range)`
- `=AVERAGE(range)`
- `=COUNT(range)`
- `=MAX(range)`
- `=MIN(range)`
- `=MEDIAN(range)`
- `=MODE(range)`
- `=STDEV.P(range)` ‚Äî (Standard Deviation for population)

üìÖ Date & Time Formulas (Also Useful in Statistics)

Formula	Description	Example

=TODAY()	Returns current date	
=NOW()	Returns current date and time	
=DATEDIF(start,end,"y/m/d")	Calculates date difference	=DATEDIF(A2,TODAY(),"y") & " years"
=YEAR(date)	Extracts year	=YEAR(A2)
=MONTH(date)	Extracts month	=MONTH(A2)
=DAY(date)	Extracts day	=DAY(A2)
=EOMONTH(start_date, months)	End of the month	=EOMONTH(TODAY(),0)
=NETWORKDAYS(start_date,end_date)	Working days between dates (excluding weekends)	=NETWORKDAYS(A2,TODAY())

üíº Real-World Use Cases

Sales Analysis ‚Äì Calculate average sales, region-wise totals using SUMIF, and understand trends with STDEV.S.

HR/Attendance ‚Äì Use NETWORKDAYS and DATEDIF for employee tenure and leave days.

Student Data ‚Äì Use RANK, QUARTILE, and PERCENTILE to assign performance percentiles.

Customer Service ‚Äì Analyze service request durations using date formulas.

üõ† Why Not Only Pivot?

While Pivot Tables are great for summary, formulas:

Allow custom logic.

Work in dynamic dashboards.

Are better for automation and conditional analysis.

Provide more fine-grained control.

‚úÖ What You‚Äôll Learn

Build a strong statistical foundation with Excel.

Use formulas alongside Pivots for more control.

Analyze real-life data without writing code.

Become confident in Excel interviews and reports.
